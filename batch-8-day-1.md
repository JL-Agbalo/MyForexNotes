### **Best Time to Buy and Sell in the Philippines (PH)**

The forex market operates 24 hours a day, but the most active trading periods are during the overlap of major market sessions. For traders in the Philippines (PH), the best times to trade are typically:

- **London Session (3:00 PM – 12:00 AM PH time):** High liquidity and volatility, especially for EUR, GBP, and USD pairs.
- **New York Session (8:00 PM – 5:00 AM PH time):** Good volatility, especially during the overlap with the London session (8:00 PM – 12:00 AM PH time).
- **London–New York Overlap (8:00 PM – 12:00 AM PH time):** The most active period with the highest trading volume.

Trading during these times can provide better opportunities for buying and selling due to increased market activity and tighter spreads.

### **Types of Traders**

- **Scalper Trader:** Makes lots of quick trades, holding stocks for only a few seconds or minutes to earn small profits from tiny price changes. Uses fast decision-making and technology to trade quickly.

- **Day Trader:** Buys and sells financial assets (like stocks) within the same trading day, aiming to profit from short-term price movements. Typically closes all positions before the market closes to avoid overnight risks.

- **Swing Trader:** Buys and sells stocks (or other assets) over a few days or weeks, aiming to profit from short-term "swings" in the market rather than holding investments for a long time.

- **Position Trader:** Buys and holds investments for a long period (weeks, months, or even years), aiming to profit from major price movements rather than short-term fluctuations.

- **Price Action Trader:** Makes decisions based only on the movement of a security’s price—without relying on indicators or news. Analyzes patterns, trends, and candlestick formations directly from the price chart.

- **Algorithmic Trader:** Uses computer programs (algorithms) to automatically buy and sell financial assets. Sets rules for the program to follow, such as when to buy or sell based on price changes or market trends, making trading faster and more consistent.
